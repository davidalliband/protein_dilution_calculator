PROTEIN DILUTION CALCULATOR FOR WESTERN BLOT

To use this tool you must format your CSV file correctly. Column A should contain your samples (e.g. Sample 1, Sample 2, Sample 3, etc.) and Column B should contain the total protein content of the sample. This will be used to calculate the volume of each Sample to be used to create a final dilution containing 20ug of protein. An example CSV file is included with this tool (BCA_example.csv).
